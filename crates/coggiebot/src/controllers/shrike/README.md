# Shrike

Shrike is a defensive mechanism to detect bad voodoo. Shrike internally scans files with `clamscan` and `stevenhost` DNS blacklist.

> Shrikes are known for their habit of catching insects and small vertebrates and impaling them on thorns, branches, the spikes on barbed-wire fences, or any available sharp point. This helps them to tear the flesh into smaller, more conveniently sized fragments, and serves as a cache so that the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time.
